# Chocolate Sales Revenue Prediction

## Project Overview
The objective of this project was to analyze chocolate sales data and predict high and low revenue orders based on various features,
such as salesperson, country, product, date, amount, and boxes shipped.

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze the chocolate sales data.
- Predict high and low revenue orders using machine learning models.
- Provide actionable insights for inventory planning, marketing strategies, and sales expansion.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following columns:
- Sales Person: Name of the salesperson.
- Country: Country where the sale occurred.
- Product: The chocolate product sold.
- Date: The date of the sale.
- Amount: Total revenue generated from the sale.
- Boxes Shipped: Number of boxes shipped.

## Key Insights:
- The dataset includes data from 6 countries, 22 products, and various other features like sales performance by salesperson and month.
- Top-performing products: Smooth Silky Salty, 50% Dark Bites, and Eclairs.
- Sales trends: High sales observed during January and February, with Tuesdays and Thursdays showing higher performance than other days.
  
## Data Analysis & Insights
- Top Salespeople: Ches Bonnell, Oby Sorrel, Madelene Upcott, and others performed well in terms of revenue generation.
- Top Countries: Australia and India led the highest sales.
- Seasonal Demand: January and February showed the highest sales due to festive demand (New Year and Valentine’s Day).
- Market Expansion Opportunities: New Zealand was identified as a region with low sales, presenting an opportunity for future growth.

## Machine Learning Models
**The following machine learning models were implemented to predict high and low revenue orders:**
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree Classifier (DTC)
- Logistic Regression (LR)
- Random Forest Classifier (RFC)

## Model Evaluation:
- KNN: Achieved an accuracy of 94.29% on the training set and 90.41% on the testing set.
- DTC: Achieved 100% accuracy on the training set and 99.54% on the testing set.
- LR: Achieved an accuracy of 99.66% on the training set and 99.09% on the testing set.
- RFC: Achieved 100% accuracy on the training set and 99.54% on the testing set.
**Among all models, Random Forest Classifier performed the best with near-perfect accuracy, precision,
  and recall across both training and testing datasets.**

## Business Insights & Recommendations
**Inventory Planning:**
- Stock up in advance for January and February to meet the demand spike.
- Ensure the availability of top-selling products during these months.

**Marketing & Sales Strategy**
- Run targeted campaigns around New Year and Valentine’s Day.
- Focus on expanding sales in New Zealand and other underperforming regions.
- 
**Product Focus**
- Prioritize marketing for high-demand products like Smooth Silky Salty and 50% Dark Bites.
