# PSL 2025 Winning Probability Prediction 

## Project Overview
T**his project uses historical Pakistan Super League (PSL) data from seasons 2016 to 2024 to predict the winning probabilities of each team for the upcoming PSL 2025 season.
The project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning modeling using Logistic Regression.**

## Dataset
- Source: Cricsheet
- Coverage: Ball-by-ball match records and match summaries
- Seasons Covered: 2016â€“2024
- Countries: Pakistan and UAE

## Teams:
- Islamabad United
- Karachi Kings
- Lahore Qalandars
- Multan Sultans
- Quetta Gladiators
- Peshawar Zalmi

## Project Workflow
- Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Correcting venue names and cities
- Feature selection and cleaning

## Feature Engineering
- Team win percentage per season
- Batting strength (average runs/match)
- Bowling strength (average runs conceded + wickets taken)
- City-wise win rate
- Chasing win rate (batting second success)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Matches played and wins per team
- Top batsmen and bowlers
- Team performances across cities and years

## Model Building
- One-hot encoding for team features
- Logistic Regression for probability estimation

## Model Evaluation
- Accuracy Score: 88%
- Confusion Matrix and Classification Report

## Winning Probability Prediction
**Predicting the chance of each team winning PSL 2025**

## Final Results 
**Team	Winning Probability (%)**
- Islamabad United	28.39%
- Multan Sultans	22.88%
- Lahore Qalandars	18.10%
- Quetta Gladiators	14.21%
- Peshawar Zalmi	13.68%
- Karachi Kings	7.24%
**Insight: Islamabad United leads with the highest chance of winning the PSL 2025 title!**

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
